In any ETL or data warehousing pipeline, how you load data matters just as much as how you transform it. Two core loading strategies-Full Load and Incremental Load are often applied differently depending on whether you're implementing SCD Type 1 or SCD Type 2.

Full Load

In a full load, the entire dataset is reloaded from source to target every time, regardless of whether data has changed.

Simple to develop and maintain

Often used in small or static datasets

Best suited for scenarios where data volume is low or change tracking isn't feasible

Incremental Load

Only new, updated, or deleted records are processed based on a tracking column (like last updated date, version number, or hash comparison).

Highly efficient for large datasets

Minimizes compute and I/O

Ideal for real-time or frequent data refresh scenarios


How They Integrate with SCDs (Slowly Changing Dimensions):

SCD Type 1 - No History

Used when historical data is not required. The record is simply overwritten.

With incremental load, only changed rows are updated.

Best for correcting errors or minor changes like spelling fixes.

SCD Type 2 - Preserves History

Used when historical tracking is required. A new row is inserted with a new surrogate key and version/timestamp.

Incremental load plays a crucial role here to identify changes and preserve historical records.

Best for business-critical dimensions like customer info, product pricing, etc.

When to Use?

Use Full Load in dev/testing or with small datasets.

Use Incremental Load with SCD2 for production-grade data warehouses that need auditability and history tracking.

Combine with CDC (Change Data Capture) or watermarking for high-performance pipelines.
