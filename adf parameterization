What is Parameterization?

In ADF, parameterization refers to the process of replacing static values with dynamic values that can be changed at runtime. This allows you to make your pipelines more flexible and reusable.

Why Parameterization?

Parameterization helps in several ways:

1. Increased Reusability: By parameterizing datasets, you can reuse the same pipeline with different datasets, reducing the need to create multiple pipelines.
2.Improved Flexibility: You can change the dataset or schema without modifying the pipeline code.
3. Simplified Maintenance: Updating the dataset or schema is easier, as you only need to update the parameterized value.

How to Parameterize a Dataset

To parameterize a dataset in ADF, follow these steps:

Step 1: Go to the Dataset

In the Azure Data Factory portal, navigate to the "Datasets" section and select the dataset you want to parameterize.

Step 2: Add a Parameter

Click on the "Parameters" tab and add a new parameter. Give a name to the parameter, for example, `@dataset().schemaName`.
and @dataset().tableName


In this example, I've selected the `salesLT` schema, so I've given `@dataset().schemaName` as `salesLT`.

**Step 4: Sink Side Parameterization**

At the sink side, you'll also need to parameterize the Adls storage. Click on the "Sink" tab and add a new parameter. Give a name to the parameter, for example, @dataset().Folder


In this example, we've parameterized the schema name at both the source and sink sides using `@dataset().schemaName,@dataset().tableName` and `@dataset().Folder` respectively.
